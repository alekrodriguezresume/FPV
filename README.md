# Custom FPV Drone Build

This project documents my custom FPV (First-Person View) drone build â€” designed for high-speed flying, freestyle, and aerial cinematography. It includes the frame, flight controller setup, motors, ESCs, FPV system, and software configuration.

## About This Build

This drone was built from scratch to achieve:
- Fast and responsive flight for freestyle and racing
- Real-time video transmission with low latency
- Durability for hard landings and rough use
- Easy repair and modular upgrades

## Setup Guide

1. **Frame Assembly** â€“ Install arms and center stack
2. **Soldering** â€“ Connect ESCs to FC, motor wires, power distribution
3. **FPV System** â€“ Mount camera and VTX; wire to FC
4. **Receiver Binding** â€“ Set up your radio link (CRSF, ELRS, etc.)
5. **Betaflight Config** â€“ Flash latest firmware, configure ports, modes, OSD
6. **Maiden Flight** â€“ Calibrate sensors, test failsafe, and do LOS hover check

## Tuning and Performance

This drone is tuned for smooth flight, responsive throttle, and stable video. PID tuning and rates were dialed in using both Blackbox logging and test flights.

## Notes

- All wiring is kept modular for quick repairs
- Flight controller supports GPS, barometer, and Blackbox logging
- Designed to be beginner-repairable but high-performance

## Future Upgrades

- GPS rescue + telemetry
- Onboard HD recording (e.g., Caddx Walnut or GoPro)
- Custom 3D-printed parts for improved protection
